#### Research Questions
- What are the current limitations of LLMs in logical reasoning?
- How does the composition of multi-agent systems affect their logical reasoning capabilities?
- Is the 'Assembly Bonus Effect' observable in multi-agent systems?
#### Points to address:
- Logical reasoning can seemingly be solved by agents using tools. This is the case at least for constraint satisfaction problems like ZebraLogicBench using SMT solvers.
- Find a niche within the research area or compete with Stanford...
	- David suggests dropping agents since tool use solves reasoning. Can we observe Assembly Bonus Effect in groups of LLMs?
		- This might be quicker to set up experiments and produce research quickly...
	- Have a psychology angle - reach out to some contacts of Davids perhaps. 
		- Requires generating suitable research questions.
