### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG involves a two-step process:
1) **Retrieval:** The system first retrieves relevant information or documents from a large corpus based on the input query. This retrieval process is often powered by a dense passage retriever or other information retrieval mechanisms.
2) **Generation:** The retrieved information is then used to generate a more accurate and contextually relevant response. This generation process is typically handled by a generative language model (such as [GPT] or [BERT]).
