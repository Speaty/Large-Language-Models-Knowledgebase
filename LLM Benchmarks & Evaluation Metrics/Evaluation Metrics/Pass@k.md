If `k` independent samples are drawn, what is the probability that at least one of them is fully correct? It aims to summarise how much benefit can be gained from extra sampling (test-time compute).
- **k = 1** ordinary accuracy
- **Larger k** potential ceiling if you could pick the best answer from `k` tries
