**The Compositionality Principle:** The meaning of a complex phrase is determined by the meanings of its parts and their syntax.

- The smallest building blocks for syntax/semantics are called **morphemes**. A morpheme cannot be decomposed further into meaningful subparts. 
	- e.g. 'cat' is a morpheme but 'cats' isn't.
- A **lexeme** is a basic unit of meaning in a language, like a word or phrase, encompassing all its inflexted forms. 
- The **lexicon** is the set of all morphemes of a language.
